# makedepf90 (for IB)

This is a copy of outpaddling's copy of Erik Edelman's code.  This repo is for the purpose of
packaging this code such that it might be used for outdated systems that still rely on this sort
of thing.

Not a criticism.

# makedepf90
This is a copy of Erik Edelman's tool for generating make dependencies for
Fortran code.

As the source code does not appear to be available at the original site, I
have posted a copy here with minor improvements for the sake of package
managers and anyone who wants to add patches.
